# FastLED-pattern-controller
A controller for WS2812 LEDs using the FastLED library with a button to cycle between patterns and a dimmer switch. Some of the patterns are for show and some for visibility. This could be attached to a bicycle or wheelchair frame.

The '3d printed box' folder includes the files I used for the box I put my electroics in. This may not be of much use to anyone else depending on the size of buttons, switches and components you use.
